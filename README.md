# Perceptrons

- Was able to clasify MNIST test set up to 0.99 but (binary input though)
- decision tree binary ~0.989, perceptrons unable to do the XOR since linearly separate
- exp1 to exp3 shows SGD (stochstic gradient descent, random mismatch selection then update w) vs. batch (whole domain at once)
